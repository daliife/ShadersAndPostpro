# Shaders And Postprocessing

## Description
Small C++ project to practise Shaders and Postprocessing FX, mainly playing around and passing editable uniforms in the fragment shader.
- You can toggle the *FX Panel Selector* ON and OFF with ``` ALT + 0 ```
- All the sliders in the panel are modifiable during the execution. They will affect parameters of the specific *FX Mode* in the dropdown.
